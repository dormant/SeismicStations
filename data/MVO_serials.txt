Yes, that's definitely a Mk3 DM24- it couldn't be anything else given the
displayed firmware version. More specifically I can see in our records (thanks
to you passing on the 3T serial number) that it's a fairly early Mk3 DM24,
integrated with an EAM into the lid of a 3T. The full serial no. is T36255/
A2241/2674.
